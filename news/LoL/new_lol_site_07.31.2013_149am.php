          Starting this coming week, we'll begin the transition to the new LeagueofLegends.com. We got a lot of great feedback from the beta testers, and, after a few minor tweaks, it's ready for live.

A lot's changed since the last site update back in Season 1, so we wanted to build a new site to support the wider range of content we're releasing these days.

Here's what you can expect from the new design:

<ul>
<li>
Streamlined navigation focused around a clearer, visual way to access news, along with new ways to find older articles
</li>
<li>
A more focused design built from the ground up to feature articles backed up by vibrant art and videos
</li>
<li>
A prominently placed community portal full of programs and fan content for you to enjoy
</li>
</ul>
</p>
