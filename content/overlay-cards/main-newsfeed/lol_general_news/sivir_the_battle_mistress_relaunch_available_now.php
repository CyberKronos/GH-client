          <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><p>Sivir, the Battle Mistress has been relaunched! Featuring improved fidelity and readability in game, Sivir returns to the battlefields wielding her newly re-emphasized boomerang blade to accompany creative updates as well as a kit rework. </p>

<p>As one of the earliest champions in the game, Sivir's visuals and effects didn't match the look and feel of newer champs. We've designed her silhouette around her weapon while improving fidelity and readability of Sivir in-game, giving her an aesthetic that matches the battle-hardened mercenary personality she's always had. New effects on her abilities emphasize the boomerang-like nature of her weapon, and should make playing Sivir feel like dashing around the fight tossing ricocheting blades and whittling enemies down from unexpected angles. </p>

<p>Along with her visuals, we identified a few mysteries we could explore in Sivir's lore. Our goals were to clearly identify her place in the world and deliver on the mercenary fantasy inherent in her story. Generic battle platitudes and lack of deep motivation previously made it difficult to become personally invested in her successes or failures. We've added new voice-over that ties in to her expanded lore and relationships. With more of her back story and a glimpse into her possible future revealed, players will have more opportunities to learn about Sivir. </p>

<header class="header-primary"><h3>Gameplay</h3></header><p>From a gameplay perspective, Sivir has a unique feel among ranged marksmen. She's a powerful counter to spell-reliant champs and offers different skills for teamfights than many marksmen with her ultimate and passive. It was extremely important to us to ensure that any changes to her kit preserved her ability to split-push, initiate and counter-initiate while opening up new options for Sivir players. With that in mind, Boomerang Blade and Spell Shield still operate the same way. Ricochet can bounce to more enemies, although it cannot hit the same target twice. We've also reduced the cooldown of On the Hunt, and redesigned it to deliver a massive move speed boost and no longer have a cast time. </p>

<h4> Fleet of Foot </h4>
<p>When Sivir hits an enemy champion with her basic attacks or abilities, she gains movement speed for a few seconds. </p>

<h4>Boomerang Blade</h4>
<p>Sivir hurls her crossblade like a boomerang, which deals physical damage to the first target hit and reduced damage to each subsequent target.</p>

		<h4>Ricochet</h4>
<p>Sivir's next three basic attacks bounce to nearby targets, dealing physical damage to the first target and reduced damage to each subsequent target. Only the first target hit procs on-hit effects. Ricochet bounces to nearby targets until there are no targets that haven't already been hit by Ricochet.</p>

<p>Sivir creates a magical barrier that blocks the next incoming enemy ability. If an ability is blocked by the shield, Sivir regains mana. Spell Shield has no mana cost.</p>

		<h4>On the Hunt</h4>
<ul><li><strong>PASSIVE: </strong>Sivir gains Attack Speed while Ricochet is active.</li>
<li><strong>ACTIVE:</strong> Sivir rallies her teammates for a duration, granting nearby allies an initial movement speed bonus that wears off to a smaller, longer-lasting movement speed buff. On the Hunt has no cast time.</li></ul></div>
</div>

<hr class="divider"><header class="header-subtle"><h4>Early-game</h4></header><p> As the laning phase begins, Sivir has a number of tools available to determine how she wants to approach the early-game. Sustain-heavy options involve using Spell Shield to regenerate mana and Boomerang Blade to harass lane opponents rather than push. Aggressive lanes might opt for heavy use of Ricochet to clear minion waves rapidly, forcing opponents up against their own turret. </p>

<hr class="divider"><header class="header-subtle"><h4>Midgame</h4></header><p> Sivir transitions well into the objective-heavy portions of the game. Because of her enormous contribution to team mobility, it becomes easy to rotate around the jungle, contesting neutral buffs and larger objectives like dragons or turrets.  The reasonably low cooldown of On the Hunt makes it difficult for the enemy team to keep up with a Sivir-led composition. </p>
<hr class="divider"><header class="header-subtle"><h4>Late-game</h4></header><p>Late-game Sivir acts as a potent split-pusher if the team composition calls for it. Thanks to her built-in movement speed steroid that can now be cast on the run, Sivir can unleash tons of damage on turrets before escaping when she needs to, blocking incoming abilities with Spell Shield along the way. For more engage-heavy teams, Sivir offers massive area of effect damage through Ricochet and maneuverability with On the Hunt. A poke-comp can initiate quick engages with Sivir-aided disengages. Using this strategy takes advantage of the amount of damage Sivir can dish out, while helping to protect more fragile poke-oriented teams. </p>

<header class="header-primary"><h3>Story</h3></header><p>When the people of Valoran speak of the ''Battle Mistress,'' there is only one woman to whom they refer. Combining unflinching bravery with prowess in combat and endless ambition, Sivir's reputation as a fortune hunter is only rivaled by her amassed wealth and acclaim. Faced with the revelation of her mysterious heritage, Sivir must now weigh her desire to follow her own path against the burden of a greater legacy. </p>
<p>Sivir grew up among the desert nomads of Shurima, mastering the art of tomb robbing and enjoying a life without strong ties to any one place. She excelled at the mercenary life, accumulating riches, followers and reputation with ease. As her fame spread beyond the desert sands, she caught the attention of wealthy patrons across all of Valoran. The most influential of these benefactors was Noxus High Command. Sivir served the whims of the brutal nation with little concern for consequence. Their partnership proved to be a profitable one until the Ionian conflict broke out. She chose to take no part in the messy invasion and severed her ties. </p>
<p>It was no surprise to Sivir when the Noxians next paid her a visit, but where she expected assassins, she instead received an offer. Cassiopeia, the daughter of one of Noxus's most influential families, claimed to have unearthed the location of ancient Shurima's greatest treasure. All that the noblewoman required was an experienced tomb robber as an escort. </p>
<p>The expedition proved to be more than Sivir and Cassiopeia bargained for. The ancient tomb held neither the treasure Cassiopeia had promised, nor the weapon she coveted. Despite Sivir's warnings, the Noxian flung open the door to the entombed vault, setting events in motion that would change not just Sivir's life, but all of Shurima forever. </p>
