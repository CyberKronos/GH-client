<p>Occasionally, we go through Summoner names and free up ones that have been inactive for long periods of time. From now on, the Summoner Name Clean Up will be automated. Based on when you played your last game and what your level is, you’ll have a period of immunity from name clean ups. Every name will initially be given 6 months of immunity and then granted one additional month for each level above level 6.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul><li>Levels 1-6: 6 months of inactivity immunity</li>
<li>Level 12: 1 year of immunity</li>
<li>Level 20: 1 year, 8 months of immunity</li>
<li>Level 30: 2 years, 6 months of immunity</li>
</ul><p>If your immunity runs out, your name will become available to other players through the Summoner Name Change option in the store. If you log in after someone claims your Summoner name, you’ll be prompted to create a new one. To be clear, your name may be taken, but your paid content and game history will remain attached to your account.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that non-immune names can only be claimed through Summoner Name Change, and not by new players. This ensures the name will be used by an active player and not someone who decided they absolutely need Trevor, 7revor, and Tr3v0r Tha 5hr3dder. It happens more often than you’d think.</p>
<p>To make it easier to snag the alias you've always wanted, you can now purchase a Summoner Name Change for <strong>13,900 IP</strong>. For players who prefer using RP, procure your new namesake for half off from <strong>January 14 to January 28 (11:59 PM PST)</strong>.</p>
<p>With so many names freed up, capture yours today!</p></div>
