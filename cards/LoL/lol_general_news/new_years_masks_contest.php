Make merry with your friends and family this upcoming New Year and celebrate a League of Legends-flavored masquerade at the same time. Show off your costuming creativity and create a mask inspired by the champions, monsters and items from the world of League of Legends. Whether you papier-mâché a terrifying Teemo or construct a truly Haunting Guise, we want to see it. <strong><a href="http://woobox.com/9or2xk">Upload it here</a> </strong>and good luck!</p>
<p>We'll pick 5 Grand prize winners and 5 Honorable mentions and the community will do the same for a total of 20 winners. All selections will be based on the quality of the submission and whether the entry is, in fact, a mask.</p>
