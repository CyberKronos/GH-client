<br><h4><strong>Jungle:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Elise (with Death Blossom Elise)</strong> – Elise was huge in all three games, with Bengi using her to assassinate high priority targets throughout chaotic team fights, as well as setting up early ganks for his team.</p>

<br><h4><strong>Mid:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Riven (with Battle Bunny Riven)</strong> – Faker was an absolute beast on Riven, picking up great solo kills on Ozone’s midlaner Dade early game and providing excellent burst in late game team fights to help secure the victory for his team.</p>

<br><h4><strong>Marksman:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Sivir (with Warrior Princess Sivir)</strong> – Sivir was an instrumental pick in all three games from both teams, but Piglet used “On the Hunt” to perfection to setup great engages and disengages for his team through the first two games.</p>

<br><h4><strong>Support:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Alistar (with Infernal Alistar)</strong> – PoohManDu was instrumental in shutting down opposing carries, with his brilliant use of exhaust in combination with “Pulverize” and “Headbutt” both in lane and in the late game.</p>
