Once activated by players, this system will message your verified email whenever a change is made to your account, ensuring that you know if any suspicious activity is happening.</p>
<p>To activate email verification and shield your account from unauthorized access just:</p>
<ul><li>Head to leagueoflegends.com and sign in</li>
<li>Click your summoner name</li>
<li>Follow the prompts to establish a verified email account</li>
</ul><p>Baddies won’t be able to change a single credential on your account without also having access to your verified email account. This is just a first step - we’re looking into many more security features to keep your account details safe like SMS protection and more, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>To say thanks, we’re offering up a 4-win IP boost for everyone that establishes a verified email account. Head back to<strong> <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank">leagueoflegends.com</a></strong> to get started.</p></div>
