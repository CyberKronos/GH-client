          <p>Woad King Darius leads his people by the might of his axe, imposing his will and cleaving those who dare cross him. The war-painted Woad King charges into the fray bearing the storied symbols of his power. His ascent to the throne began when he single-handedly slew the beast whose head now adorns his battle armor. The axe, armor and face-paint are rounded out by new particle effects and a unique recall animation.</p>
