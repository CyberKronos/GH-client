            <p>Aatrox</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Aatrox, the Darkin Blade is in this build but will be turned on at a later date.</li> 
            </ul>
            

            <p>Annie</p>
            <p>We’ve made some changes to Tibbers to make him a tankier and more threatening presence in late game team fights beyond his initial burst damage.</p>
            

            <p>Summon: Tibbers</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tibbers’ Health increased to 1200/2100/3000 from 1200/1600/2000</li>
              <li>Tibbers’ Magic Resist increased to 30/50/70 from 25/45/65</li>
              <li>Mana cost reduced to 100 at all ranks from 125/175/225</li>
            </ul> 

            
            
            <p>Ashe</p>
            <p>This change allows Ashe players to use her passive in more strategic ways beyond a level one poke or incidental crit.</p>

            <p>Focus</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ashe now gains 3/4/5/6 Focus stacks every second while not attacking instead of gaining Critical Strike Chance</li>
              <li>Ashe will critically strike on her next basic attack when she reaches 100 Focus stacks</li>
              <li>Initial Focus stacks are equal to Ashe's Critical Strike Chance</li>
            </ul> 


            <p>Corki</p>

            
            
            <p>Missile Barrage</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a bug where Missile Barrage would sometimes fail to deal damage</li>
            </ul> 


            
            
            <p>Hecarim</p>
            <p>As a strong sustain fighter, Hecarim was blowing up squishy targets with Onslaught of Shadows’ high damage and on-impact fear. To balance the ability out, we’ve taken away the landing damage and shifted it to the riders that travel with Hecarim.</p>
            <p>The Devastating Charge buff should let Hecarim jump over small walls and ledges to his opponents when he dashes to them. Keep in mind that when we say small ledges, there are only a few in the game like the river ramp ledges and very thin jungle walls.</p>


            <p>Devastating Charge</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If Hecarim's target is beyond narrow terrain, Hecarim will now leap over the terrain to the target</li>
            </ul> 


            <p>Onslaught of Shadows</p> 
            <ul>
              <li>No longer deals damage at the end location</li>
              <li>Rider damage increased to 150/250/350 (+1.0 Ability Power) from 100/200/300 (+0.4 Ability Power)</li>
            </ul>
