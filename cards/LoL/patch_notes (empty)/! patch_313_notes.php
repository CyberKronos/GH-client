		<strong>PvP.net Service / Client</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>We made some changes that allow us to dynamically provide “Loss Forgiven” to servers experiencing hardware or connection issues. Players should see this more often if their game servers are having issues
		</li>
		<li>We can now disable in-game items and features on the fly, so if there are new bugs or exploits, we’ll disable things on a more sophisticated level rather than turning off all ranked games
		</li>
	</ul><ul><li>Improved Champ Select Timer accuracy and reliability (to be turned on at a later date).
			<ul><li>The client will now actively sync its timer with the server during every phase. If your original timer is behind, you may see a jump as it syncs up with the server (e.g. jumping from 60 to 50 if you are 10 seconds behind). But you will no longer run into situations like having seconds left on your timer but having your selection window end prematurely.
				</li>
				<li>We've also reintroduced the numbers 89 to the beginning timer, and 9 into the post Lock-In timer (did you realize they were missing?).
				</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>Fixed an issue which would cause the screen to briefly flicker black when selecting a skin in Champ Select
		</li>
		<li>Temporary summoner icons for the Season 3 World Championship teams have been removed from the client
		</li>
		<li>Fixed an issue where purchased champions or skins would disappear in rare circumstances
		</li>
	</ul><hr class="divider"><a class="anchor" name="patch-Friends-List" id="patch-Friends-List"></a>
	<p>
		<strong>Friends List</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Added redundancies to fix corrupted friends lists commonly caused by 3rd party chat clients
		</li>
		<li>This will fix the following:
			<ul><li>Online friends appearing offline
				</li>
				<li>Opening the wrong friend when clicking on another
				</li>
				<li>Friends appearing to be another friend
				</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>Fixed an issue where a player with a pending friend request would appear online after sending them a game invite
		</li>
		<li>Group Chat Panels received a visual update to match the new updated friends list

		<strong>Attack Speed slows</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Attack speed slows (IE: Nasus' Wither) were immune to cleanse or other forms of debuff removal unless attached to a movement impairing effect. Now all attack speed slows can be cleansed and are treated like movement speed slows.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> We’re updating attack speed slows in order to have more consistent counterplay related to debuff removal. Essentially, we're looking to treat all slows the same, whether they're movement or attack speed based.
	</p>

	<ul><li>Attack Speed slows can now be cleansed as if they were movement-impairing crowd control effects

		<strong>Champions with dashes tied to their ultimates</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> The following champions will now be affected by snaring or stunning crowd control abilities after they complete their dashes. Their spells will still be unstoppable, but most forms of crowd control landed while the champion’s using the ability will be applied after the spell completes. CC duration will tick down while a champion is mid-dash.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> We're adding more counterplay for champions who have long-range dashes tied to their ultimates by making them susceptible to certain forms of crowd control after they complete a dash - like snares or stuns. Now if a teammate lands a snare in the middle of a champion's dash, the ulting champion will complete their ability, but be snared at the end.
	</p>

	<ul><li>Crowd control effects can now be received during "unstoppable" movement ultimates (they previously discarded all crowd control effects), but those ultimates will still finish their movement regardless (crowd control effects can persist after the cast finishes)

	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Blood Well’s passive attack speed bonus now scales with character level (lower at earlier levels, higher at max level). Blades of Torment’s damage has been reduced (equal at lower levels, lower at max levels).
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> Any champion can be frustrating to play against when they’re capable of building very tanky while still outputting considerable DPS, so we're lowering some of Aatrox’s innate damage. With this change, Aatrox must build items for damage and won’t be able to simultaneously tank and smash face as easily.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Blood Well</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Passive Attack Speed changed to 30/35/40/45/50/55% (upgrades every 3 champion levels) (from 50% flat)
		</li>
	</ul><p>
		<strong>Blades of Torment</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Damage reduced to 75/110/145/180/215 (from 75/120/165/210/255)
		</li>
	</ul><hr class="divider"><p>
		<a class="anchor" name="patch-ahri" id="patch-ahri"></a><strong class="ahri">Ahri</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Charm has had its mana cost changed to a flat amount at all levels but now increases the magic damage Ahri deals to a Charmed target. Essence Theft now heals her for a specific amount based on the number of enemies she hits with her passive-enhanced spell, as opposed to getting straight spell vamp. Fox Fire now deals less damage when multiple wisps hit the same target. Spirit Rush's base damage and AP ratios have been slightly reduced.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> Ahri is a champion with a lot of strengths and few weaknesses, given her high versatility and reliability, so she can consistently apply a lot of pressure on her opponents from relative safety. Ahri’s strengths should be better defined than they currently are. These changes give Ahri players (and her opponents) clear areas of mastery that differentiate the good Ahris from the great Ahris. Our core focuses are:
	</p>

	<ul><li>Make Ahri’s default lane patterns more clear, so both Ahri and her opponents can make plays around them
		</li>
		<li>Make Ahri’s “all-in” gameplay more closely tied with landing Charm to establish Charm as Ahri’s “kiss of death” that needs to be avoided, as well as lower her threat/presence while Charm is on cooldown
		</li>
		<li>Keep Ahri’s core gameplay intact while trimming away strength from the low-gameplay patterns that don’t feel rewarding
		</li>
	</ul><p>
		<strong>Essence Theft</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Now heals Ahri for 2 (+1 per champion level) (+0.09 Ability Power) each time her passive-enhanced spells hit an enemy (previously 35% Spell Vamp)
		</li>
	</ul><p>
		<strong>Fox-Fire</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Mana cost reduced to 50 (from 60)
		</li>
		<li>Diminishing returns effect on same-target hits increased to 70% (from 50%) (best case is now 100% + 30% + 30%)
		</li>
		<li>This reduces the same-target damage to 64/104/144/184/224 (+0.64 Ability Power) (from 80/130/180/230/280 (+0.8 Ability Power))
		</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug that caused Fox-Fire to sometimes deal reduced damage to a target that should receive the standard damage amount
		</li>
	</ul><p>
		<strong>Charm</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Now increases the magic damage Ahri deals to the target by 20% for 6 seconds
		</li>
		<li>Mana cost changed to 85 (from 50/65/80/95/110)
		</li>
	</ul><p>
		<strong>Spirit Rush</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Base damage reduced to 70/110/150 (+0.3 Ability Power) (from 85/125/165 (+0.35 Ability Power))
		</li>
		<li>This reduces the max damage per target to 210/330/450 (+0.9 Ability Power) (from 255/375/495 (+1.05 Ability Power))

		<a class="anchor" name="patch-corki" id="patch-corki"></a><strong class="corki">Corki</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Corki's base attack speed has been reduced. Missile Barrage's base damage has been reduced at earlier ranks and the cooldown between missile shots has been increased. Additionally, the cooldown between missile shots can no longer be reduced by cooldown reduction, but CDR will still affect how quickly you can gain missile ammo.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> Overall, we like the direction we pushed Corki toward with Trinity Force, but currently he's too overwhelming to play against. Here we're reducing excess power in a few areas to put him more in line with other similar spell-based ADCs. Ultimately, Missile Barrage should function as a powerful sustained damage tool rather than a source of burst damage.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>General</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Base Attack Speed reduced to 0.625 (from 0.658)

	<ul><li>Base damage reduced to 100/180/260 (from 120/190/260)
		</li>
		<li>Cooldown between missile shots increased to 2 seconds (from 1.2)
		</li>
		<li>Cooldown between missile shots can no longer be reduced by Cooldown Reduction (Cooldown Reduction still affects how quickly you gain missile ammo)

	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> The active ability power ratio of Seastone Trident has been reduced significantly.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> We’re aiming to reduce some of Fizz’s late game damage so that he has to rely more on successfully landing his ultimate or finding a way to stall until his next set of cooldowns come up in order to successfully assassinate targets in late game fights.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Playful / Trickster</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Fixed a bug where Fizz became targetable while still descending from Playful (he now only becomes targetable after landing, just like Trickster)
		</li>
	</ul><p>
		<strong>Seastone Trident</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Active Ability Power ratio reduced to 0.15 (from 0.35)

		<a class="anchor" name="patch-heimerdinger" id="patch-heimerdinger"></a><strong class="heimerdinger">Heimerdinger</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Heimerdinger’s kit has been significantly reworked this patch. Techmaturgical Repair Bots no longer works on friendly turrets. H-28G Evolution Turrets now fire a beam every twelve seconds in a projected line shot in addition to their regular attacks. Additionally, H-28G Evolution Turret will now shut down after a period of time if Heimerdinger leaves the area. Hextech Micro-Rockets have been reworked to unleash a barrage of rockets that converge at your cursor before fanning out. Enemies hit by more than one rocket take reduced magic damage from additional rockets. CH-1 Electron Storm Grenade now travels in an arc.<br><br>
		UPGRADE!!! makes Heimerdinger’s next spell free while also applying bonus effects. Upgrading H-28G Evolution Turret transforms it into a giant H-28Q Apex Turret that deals higher damage with a lower cooldown beam. Upgrading Hextech Micro-Rockets transforms it into Hextech Rocket Swarm, where Heimerdinger fires out four waves of rockets that deal damage on impact. Finally, upgrading the CH-1 Electron Storm Grenade transforms it into a CH-3X Lightning Grenade that bounces three times (dealing damage and stunning with each bounce) before disappearing.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> Heimerdinger’s got some new toys! Our core goal was to give Heimerdinger the tools to differentiate himself in ability use and build optimization. In particular, we focused on diversifying the Heimerdinger experience so that each of Heimer’s abilities comes with its own form of gameplay and interaction – players will need to think carefully about how to use each in an optimal way. Raise your turrets!

		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Null Sphere has had its mana cost and damage reduced at later levels. The silence duration of Null Sphere has been increased at lower levels but very slightly lowered at max level. Riftwalk’s base damage and bonus damage per stack has been increased in addition to having a small AP ratio added per stack. Additionally, Riftwalk now refunds 50% of the total mana cost when it damages an enemy champion. Finally, Kassadin no longer gains magic resistance per level.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> Currently we feel like Kassadin’s play beyond the laning phase is too safe, especially when he gets ahead. He can deal consistently high damage at range with Null Sphere and Force Pulse while holding on to Riftwalk for a safe escape. These changes are focused on forcing Kassadin to use Riftwalk as a significant part of his damage output, which also gives opponents opportunities to capitalize on his mistakes.

		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Morgana’s attack range, base attack speed, and basic attack animation have been improved across the board. Tormented Soil no longer reduces magic resistance per tick, instead it deals additional damage based on an enemy's missing health. Morgana should deal roughly the same amount of overall damage, although there’ll be some variation due to how the new Tormented Soil works.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> This change is more of a modernization of Morgana and her Tormented Soil by rewarding her for being continuously aggressive with landing her Dark Bindings. Specifically, we wanted to reinforce Morgana's standard damage combo of Dark Binding to Tormented Soil, rather than the "ideal" combo of using Tormented Soil's magic resistance reduction to make Dark Binding deal more damage.

However, now that we’ve addressed some of his old core issues, we feel like we can be more aggressive with tweaking his kit balance.

Sivir’s Ricochet will now be active for the next three attacks after casting and each attack bounces infinitely, provided it can find new targets to bounce to (it will never hit the same target twice). Additionally, targets hit by a bounce will take a flat percentage amount of damage. Spell Shield no longer costs mana to cast. On The Hunt no longer has a cast time but doesn’t provide a flat bonus attack speed aura. On The Hunt now provides a large movement speed boost that wears off to a smaller, longer lasting movement speed buff. On The Hunt also provides a passive attack speed bonus when Sivir activates Ricochet. Finally, Sivir no longer runs in slow motion (her movement speed remains unaffected).

	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> When we approached reworking Sivir, we shied away from homogenizing her as another generic Marksman. Instead we took a route where we wanted to highlight Sivir’s unique traits, like her ability to deal high area-of-effect damage with Ricochet and her large team-wide mobility boost in On the Hunt. Our focus here is to ensure that dedicated Sivir players will still be able to enjoy the core gameplay mechanics they’ve come to appreciate while also bringing Sivir up to our modern gameplay standards and aesthetics.

		<em> The following changes are for Crystal Scar, Howling Abyss, and Twisted Treeline only </em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Grez's Spectral Lantern</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Grez’s Spectral Lantern’s combine cost has gone up and the damage has been reduced slightly. The active’s vision duration, cast range, and how long enemy champions stay revealed after exiting the dust have all been reduced significantly.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> This item was too cost effective for what it offered and these changes are to bring it more in line with other vision items in terms of cost and utility.

	<ul><li>Combine cost increased to 350 Gold (from 150)
			<ul><li>Total cost increased to 1450 Gold (from 1250)

		</li>
		<li>Cast range decreased to 800 (from 1200)
		</li>
	</ul><hr class="divider"><p>
		<strong>The Lightbringer</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> The Lightbringer’s cost is being increased (partially due to Grez’s Spectral Lantern’s cost increase), and it is gaining additional defensive stats (health / armor / lifesteal) in exchange for a damage reduction. The active’s vision duration, cast range, and how long enemy champions stay revealed after exiting the dust have all been reduced significantly.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> Lightbringer is a niche item and will still be a niche item, but this build change will open it up to more champions.

	<ul><li>Combine cost increased to 575 Gold (from 300)
			<ul><li>Total cost increased to 2500 Gold (from 2425)

		<li>Armor increased to 25 (from 20)

		<li>Lifesteal increased to 15% (from 12%)

	</ul><hr class="divider"><p>
		<strong>Hextech Sweeper</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Hextech Sweeper now builds out of a Kindlegem and Fiendish Codex. The overall cost has gone up and most stats have been reduced (health / AP). The movement speed bonus has been removed and the cooldown reduction has been increased. The active’s vision duration, cast range, and how long enemy champions stay revealed after exiting the dust have all been reduced significantly.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> Hextech Sweeper is a staple item on Twisted Treeline / Dominion and we don't want to change that, but we're making it a little less universally appealing by reducing the stats and removing the movement speed bonus. We're also giving it a cooldown reduction boost to help out with some AP itemization issues.
	</p>

	<ul><li>Combine cost increased to 530 Gold (from 200)
			<ul><li>Total cost increased to 2300 Gold (from 1920)

		<strong>Sanguine Blade</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> At 50 AD, this item was too cost efficient for what it offered. We’ve reduced some of the stats and raised the cost in order to bring this item more in line.
	</p>

	<ul><li>Combine cost increased to 600 Gold (from 500)

	<p>
		<strong>General</strong>
	</p>
	<ul><li>Turrets now have inventory items that describe turret mechanics

	</ul><hr class="divider"><p>
		<strong>Blackfire Torch</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Blackfire Torch has gained bonus movement speed in exchange for a higher overall cost and a shorter duration on the magic damage amplification active.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> Blackfire Torch is gaining the movement speed bonus that Hextech Sweeper had because while not everyone who uses AP should get an easily-accessed movement speed item, we do feel that AP casters should have one in smaller maps like Twisted Treeline and Crystal Scar.
	</p>

	<ul><li>Combine cost increased to 970 Gold (from 720)
			<ul><li>Total cost increased to 2650 Gold (from 2400)

		<strong>Twin Shadows</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Summary:</strong> Twin Shadows’ overall cost has been reduced and the cooldown on the active has been reduced significantly, however the bonus ability power and magic resistance is being lowered.
	</p>
	<p class="pn_darkred">
		<strong class="pn_black">Context:</strong> Twin Shadows is a great item on wardless maps, but the cooldown was too long to really make use of it. It's been made cheaper to increase accessibility, while the stats have been reduced to reflect the new cost.
